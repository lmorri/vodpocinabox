Leveraging this hyperparameter allows you to control the nuance you see in the results. This parameter and its behavior will be unique to every dataset you encounter, and depends on the goals of the business. You can iterate on the value of this hyperparameter until you are satisfied with the results, or you can start by leveraging Personalize's hyperparameter optimization (HPO) feature.
